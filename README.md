# Json parser in c++
I would improve my c++, so I would ripropose a Json parser written in c++ 20.
I use this standard for the variant feature. I type-safe template for manage multiple data.
I also use multiple data structure already presents on std like map and vector.
For the parsing algorithm, I use recursive-descending parser.
I use Clion for code it. I not use the agent (I have not the "pro-version"). I think it is enough easy to use.
In the end... c++ is very hard to manage. The new standard make C a distant memory.
Last but not least, operators overload is funny! I am a fun of its.

## How use it
In the main.cc there are some test. The code is very simple,  but maybe i neet to add more comments.
