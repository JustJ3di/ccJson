# Json parser in c++
I want to improve my C++ skills, so I decided to reimplement a JSON parser written in C++20.
I use this standard mainly for the std::variant feature, which allows me to build a type-safe template for handling multiple data types.
I also rely on standard library data structures such as std::map and std::vector.

For the parsing algorithm, I implemented a recursive-descent parser.
I use CLion to write the code, it works very well.

In the end, C++ is still quite hard to manage, but the new standards make C feel like a distant memory.
And last but not least — operator overloading is fun! I’m a big fan of it.

## How use it
In main.cc, there are a few test cases.
The code is quite simple, but I might need to add more comments for clarity.
